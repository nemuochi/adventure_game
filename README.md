# adventure_game
A simple old version of text game
1. Run __python3 adventure_game.py__ in terminal.
2. Texts will appear in terminal and ask you which way to go, then enter your choice.
  - You are in the field, 
  Enter 1 to know the door of the house
  or
  Enter 2 to peer into the cave
3. Eventually, the game comes to end, you can choose to play again or not.
  - GAME OVER. Would you like to play again? (y/n)
